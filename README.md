# My-Own-Wardrobe

Purpose:

This Applications purpose is to allow for it’s users to take pictures of their own wardrobe and then have it digitally placed into a virtual wardrobe. This will allow for users to easily track, share, and create outfits for themselves without needing to waste time looking in their own physical wardrobe or what their needs might be.

Problem:

Wardrobes are how we physically store our clothes. But wouldn’t it be nicer to have our wardrobe accessible by the click of a button? What if you were talking amongst your friends and need help picking out an outfit? What if you would like to see what outfits you have already picked out and have it ready to wear? What if you want to see what you own thats green or white? With this app Wardrobe, we got you covered.

App Functionality:


1. Storage
2. Sharing
3. Outfit Creator
4. Color Analyzation 
1. Storage

The apps main function is that of storing. Wardrobe will take the photo given and strip it down to just the clothing within the photo and place it inside the users wardrobe. Users can have multiple wardrobes and can customize it based on suggestions such as Seasonal, Trendy, etc. Not only will users have these custom wardrobes they will also be able to have outfit based wardrobes where preselected items are entirely separated from the clothes pile themselves, granting users a sense of organization.

Further development will include suggestions of an outfit based on what clothes are inside of the wardrobe, but for now we will focus on the main functionality of keeping it a storage based system.


2. Sharing

User’s will be able to easily share their entire wardrobe or preselected items that will be a clickable link either directing to the app itself or some sort of website placeholder showcasing the clothes and or outfits the user initially decided to share.
